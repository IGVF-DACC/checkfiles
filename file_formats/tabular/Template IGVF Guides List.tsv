Chromosome of the target of the perturbation (e.g., guideRNA, guideRNA pair). For guideRNA, use PAM.	Zero-based starting position of the target of the perturbation (e.g., guideRNA, guideRNA pair). As with BED format, the start position in each BEDPE feature is therefore interpreted to be 1 greater than the start position listed in the feature. For guideRNA, use PAM.	One-based ending position of the target of the tested perturbation (e.g., guideRNA, guideRNA pair). For guideRNA, use PAM.	gene|PerturbationTargetID. For non-expression screens, gene is 'NA'. For guide files, PerturbationTargetID is the guide's PAM in standard bed format. For negative controls (safes or non-targeting), gene is 'NA'. For safe-targeting controls, PerturbationTargetID is its PAM. For non-targeting controls, PerturbationTargetID is NT_n, where n is the unique identifying number for that sgRNA. Names must be unique	Strand of perturbation target (eg. of gRNA) [+,-,.]; if strandedness is unclear or unnecessary, use '.' for the strand	See name column for details on defining PerturbationTargetID.	Chromosome of the TSS of the tested/measured gene TSS. 'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression.	Zero-based starting position of the tested/measured TSS. As with BED format, the start position in each BEDPE feature is therefore interpreted to be 1 greater than the start position listed in the feature.  'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression.	One-based ending position of the tested/measured gene TSS.  'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression.	Strand of gene TSS [+,-,.]. 'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression; if strandedness is unclear or unnecessary, use '.' for the strand	HGNC Gene Symbol of target measured gene. 'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression.	Ensembl Gene ID. 'NA' for screens that measure phenotypes other than gene expression.	For single guides, there is only one protospacer sequence.	The gRNA sequence targeting the protospacer, as synthesized -- i.e. with the 'default' 5' G appended ONLY if it was included in the synthesis design. If no 5' G was appended to each guide, the value here is identical to the guideSpacerSeq column.	A qualitative classifier for the type of guide. Must be either 'negative_control' or 'targeting'.	Free text; 'NA' if no notes.
